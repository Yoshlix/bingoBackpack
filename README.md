## 🎯 How It Works

### Item Drops
When a player kills a mob, there's a configurable chance to drop a random bingo item (based on rarity weights). Items are NBT-tagged paper items with custom names, lore, and effects.

### Item Rarity
- **COMMON** (⚪) - Frequently dropped, basic effects
- **UNCOMMON** (🟢) - Moderate rarity, useful utilities
- **RARE** (🔵) - Rare drops, powerful effects
- **EPIC** (🟣) - Very rare, game-changing abilities
- **LEGENDARY** (🟡) - Extremely rare, ultimate power

### Team System
The mod integrates with Yet Another Bingo's team system. Team backpacks are persistent and survive server restarts. Many items affect entire teams or target enemy teams.

## 🛠️ For Developers

### Adding New Items

1. Create a new class extending `BingoItem`:
```java
public class MyNewItem extends BingoItem {
    public MyNewItem() {
        super("my_new_item", ItemRarity.RARE, true); // droppable
    }
    
    @Override
    protected boolean use(ServerPlayer player, ItemStack stack) {
        // Your item logic here
        return true; // Consumed successfully
    }
}
```

2. Register in `BingoItemRegistry.java`:
```java
register(new MyNewItem());
```

3. The item will automatically:
   - Be registered in the item system
   - Be added to the droppable pool (if marked droppable)
   - Work with `/backpack items give my_new_item`
   - Appear in `/backpack items list`

### API Access
```java
// Get BingoApi instance
BingoApi api = BingoBackpack.getBingoApi();

// Access teams, game state, objectives, etc.
api.getTeams();
api.getPlayerTeam(player);
api.completeGoal(team, goal);
```
